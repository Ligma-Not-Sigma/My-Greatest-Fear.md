# My Greatest Fear

## My greatest fear is **failure**

##### A lot of things I do, I hesitate to do them due to a fear of failure.

It is a persistent thought in the back of my head and often affects my performance, especially in sports. The constant fear makes me hesitate in making decisions, and in the fast-paced sports I play, this hesitation has a significant impact on my performance.

### Situations where my greatest fear comes into play are:
- Sports
- Important events
- Academics
- Social situations
- Public events
- Performing in front of people

Slowly but surely, the fear is getting better, and I am ***slowly*** overcoming it. However, it remains one of my greatest and most consistent fears in life.

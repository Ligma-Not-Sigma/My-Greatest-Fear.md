## my greatest fear is **failure**
##### a lot of things i do i hesitate to do them due to a fear of failure
its like a very persistent thought in the back of my head a lot and ends up making me perform **bad** especially in sports 
alot of times where my greeatest fear comes into play is:
- sports
- academics
- social situations
- pubic events
  #### although it is not constant and very simple to overcome a simple option isnt an easy option but it is getting better

# My-Greatest-Fear.md

## my greatest fear is **failure**
##### a lot of things i do i hesitate to do them due to a fear of failure
its like a very persistent thought in the back of my head a lot and ends up making me perform **bad** especially in sports 
the constant fear makes me hesitate on decisions and espcially in the sports i play that are fast paced the hesitation does a very large impact on my performance
### alot of times where my greatest fear comes into play is:
- sports
- important events
- academics
- social situations
- pubic events
- performing infront of people

 slowly but surely the fear is getting better and im ***slowly*** overcoming it but it is still one of my greatest fears and my *most* consistent fear in life
